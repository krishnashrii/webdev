1.How internet works?
The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate via standardized protocols such as TCP/IP. Information is exchanged in the form of packets routed through various networks until they reach their destination.

.The Internet is a communication medium that consists of the help of a Network. A network is none other than the reserve of devices where millions of computers and other electronic devices get connected. It uses Transmission Control Protocols to exchange data with other devices.


2.How browser works?
A browser fetches and displays web pages. It communicates with web servers using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to request resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. It parses HTML to construct the Document Object Model (DOM), renders CSS to apply styles, executes JavaScript for interactivity, and displays the final web page to the user.


. A web browser takes you anywhere on the internet. It retrieves information from other parts of the web and displays it on your desktop or mobile device. The information is transferred using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which defines how text, images and video are transmitted on the web.


3.What is Server?
A server is a computer or software that provides functionality to other programs or devices, known as clients. In the context of the web, a server hosts and serves web pages, applications, or data to users upon request.
A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine might be a dedicated server or it might be used for other purposes.

In the client/server programming model, a server program awaits and fulfills requests from client programs, which might be running in the same, or other computers. A given application in a computer might function as a client with requests for services from other programs and as a server of requests from other programs.




4.What are the types of server available?
Types of servers include:

Web Server: Hosts web pages (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
Database Server: Stores and manages databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
File Server: Stores and manages files (e.g., FTP servers).
Application Server: Provides middleware for application logic (e.g., Java EE servers).
What is SEO? Importance of SEO?
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing web pages to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). It helps increase visibility, traffic, and credibility, making it crucial for businesses and websites to attract organic traffic from search engines.

5.What is Accessibility?
Accessibility refers to designing products, devices, services, or environments that are accessible to people with disabilities. In web design, accessibility ensures that websites and web applications are usable by everyone, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

6.What is Markup Language?
 Markup languages are computer languages that are used to structure, format, or define relationships between different parts of text documents with the help of symbols or tags inserted in the document. These languages are more readable than usual programming languages with strict syntax. There are several markup languages available but the most popular among them are as follows.

HTML
XML
XHTML
SGML


7.What is HTML?
HTML is a markup language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page using a variety of tags and attributes.

8.What is browser engine?
A browser engine (layout engine) is a software component that renders web content such as HTML, CSS, and images. Examples include Blink (used in Chrome, Edge), Gecko (used in Firefox), and WebKit (used in Safari).

9.What is rendering engine? Share the available rendering engines.
A rendering engine is part of a browser or application that interprets markup languages and stylesheets to present visual content. Examples include:

Blink (Chrome, Edge)
Gecko (Firefox)
WebKit (Safari)
Trident (older versions of Internet Explorer)

10.What is JavaScript Engine? Share the available JS engines. Purpose of JS Engine?
A JavaScript engine executes JavaScript code. Examples include:

V8 (used in Chrome, Node.js)
SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox)
JavaScriptCore (used in Safari)
Chakra (used in Microsoft Edge, deprecated)
The purpose of a JS engine is to parse and execute JavaScript code within web browsers or server-side environments like Node.js.

11.How website works?
Websites work by browsers sending requests to servers for web pages, which are then delivered to the browser as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. The browser renders these resources to display the web page to the user.

12.What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. Examples include arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.

13.Explain Tree Data Structure?
A tree data structure consists of nodes connected by edges where each node has zero or more children nodes. It has a hierarchical structure with a root node at the top and branches leading to leaf nodes at the bottom.

14.What is user agent? Share the list and its purpose?
A user agent is a string of text sent by browsers to websites to identify themselves. Examples include:

Chrome: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36
Firefox: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0
Safari: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/15.1 Safari/605.1.15
Its purpose is to inform servers about the user's operating system, browser version, and capabilities.

15.What is Hypertest?
It seems there might be a typo here. If you meant "Hypertext," it refers to text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access.

16.What is HTML Tags?
HTML tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets (<>) that define the structure and content of web pages. They consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (e.g., <p>Content</p>).

17.What is HTML Attributes?
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are specified within the start tag and can modify the element's behavior or appearance (e.g., <a href="https://example.com">Link</a>).

18.What is HTML Elements?
HTML elements are components of an HTML document defined by tags that structure content on a web page. Examples include headings (<h1> to <h6>), paragraphs (<p>), images (<img>), etc.

19.How do you convert elements to a tree?
Elements in an HTML document are converted to a tree-like structure known as the Document Object Model (DOM) during parsing. Each HTML element becomes a node, and their relationships form a hierarchical tree.

20.What is DOCTYPE?
DOCTYPE (Document Type Declaration) is an instruction to web browsers and validators about the version of HTML or XHTML used in a web document. It ensures the document is parsed correctly and rendered according to standards.

21.What are the ways we can save HTML file?
HTML files can be saved locally on a computer using various methods:

Save directly from a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
Export from a web browser (e.g., right-click and "Save Page As...").
Download from a web server via FTP or other file transfer protocols.
22.What is charset? Why do we need to use this?
Charset (character encoding) specifies how characters are represented in a document. It ensures that text displays correctly across different platforms and languages. Common charsets include UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.

23.What is meta data? What is the purpose of it?
Metadata is data that describes other data. In HTML, <meta> tags provide metadata about the HTML document (e.g., character set, author, viewport settings). They are used by browsers, search engines, and other web services.

24.Explain Web Application Architecture?
Web Application Architecture refers to the structure and layout of components that make up a web application. It typically includes:

Client-side: The interface and interactions seen by users (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Server-side: Backend logic and data storage (server, database, application server).
Networking: Protocols and communication channels between clients and servers (HTTP, WebSocket).
Security: Measures to protect data and prevent unauthorized access (SSL/TLS, authentication).
